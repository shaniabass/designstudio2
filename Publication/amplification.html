	<p>The promotion of toxic masiculinity in society has been prevalent for years and has led to many issues such as bullying and the fear of coming out as gay. However, a major issue is the idea that "Boys Don't Cry", resulting in many men and boys being afraid to express emotions that are not seen as "macho" or "manly", such as fear, anxiety or depression. <br><br>As a result, many men who do suffer from depression or suicidal thoughts are afraid to seek help. Because of this, even though more women suffer from <br>suicidal depression overall, an overwhelming majority of men actually go through with taking their own lives as their mental health issues often go completely <br> unnoticed or are not taken seriously. A staggering 79% of all US suicides result in the deaths of males.</p>

	<p><span class="pink">Reflection: </span>It was said in critique that the audio piece and t-shirt designs were strong, though I could possibly introduce a range of t-shirt designs, perhaps <br>some with fewer words and more graphics. However, it was suggested that I play around with the colors and typography of the memorial website, and also <br>give the names some context. It would also be more powerful to have more civilians and fewer popular entertainers on the list.</p><br>
	<p><span class="pink">Extension: </span>If I were to move forward, I would combine all of these ideas into a single campaign in the form of a website. The site would have a page or two explaining the issue, on which the sound piece would feature, as well as links to various helplines and resources. The memorial would be its own page, to <br>which visitors could add names of their loved once. I would also design more t-shirts and have a "Shop" page on the website, where users could buy the <br>shirts, with the proceeds going to charity.</p>

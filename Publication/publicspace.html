	<p class="question"><span class="pink">Question: </span> How much of the earth's freshwater is in ice sheets and glaciers?</p><br><br>
	<p><span class="pink">Idea #1:</span> This would be a series of posters put up around bus stations. The graphic on them represents the fact <br>that glaciers hold a very large percentage of the earth's freshwater, but due to Global Warming, they are melting <br> at a record rate. The sea level would rise by over 200 feet is all the glaciers were to melt today, which would almost <br>equal the current height of glaciers. The QR code links to a mobile website with fast facts about the situation.</p>

	<p><span class="pink">Idea #2:</span> This would be a sculpture situated in a public space, such as Boston's Seaport using the same form as in <br>the posters. However, the sea levels would be represented by a piece of wood, and the glaciers by a carved piece of <br>ice which would melt over time, giving a more visual demonstration of the issue.</p>

	<br><br>
	<p><span class="pink">Idea #3:</span> This would involve filling up an ice rink with a series of small 3D models in the same shape as the original <br>graphic. The models would have the facts written on them, and as visitors take them, the ice beneath will be revealed, <br>as if it has melted away.</p>

	<p><span class="pink">Reflection: </span>It was said in critique, and I agree, that Idea #1 is the strongest as it is simple, ubiquitous, and placed in an <br>area frequented by many types of people.</p>
